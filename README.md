# csvtoartics
Python utility for converting CSV spreadsheet data into a .plist file for Logic Pro X Articulations system

Prep your articulation data on a spreadsheet such as Google Sheets, then download that as a .csv.

Run the CSV through this utility and it will create a .plist file that you can then place in the Articulation Settings folder (typically "~/Music/Audio Music Apps/Articulation Settings").

On restarting Logic, this will become available as an articulation set in the dropdown menu for an instrument.
